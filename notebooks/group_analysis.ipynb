    "This notebook provides functions for group analysis based on sound deviations observed in individual plays. As a basis it takes a file with standard deviations per sound for each play as input. Individual functions obtain information on the percentage of plays with a deviation, the average number of deviations over the corpus and among those plays that have at least one deviation as well as the number of deviations where sounds occur more frequently and where they occur less frequently than average. In addition, the number of times individual sounds deviate is provided, presented from most deviating to less often deviating sound."
